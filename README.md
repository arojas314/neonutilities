The National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) offers ecological data from sites across the United States through the [NEON Data Portal](https://data.neonscience.org/). **neonutilities** is a python package that makes it easy to find and download data to your local computer. We also provide some additional utilities to visualize and analyze the data.
